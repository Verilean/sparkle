# Certified-roundtrip — open work

Living checklist for the certified-compilation track (branch
`poc/roundtrip-proof`, PR #134).  Grouped by area; ordering within a
group is rough priority.  Update as items land.

## A. Composition chain (Signal ≡ emitted SystemVerilog)

- [x] The seam: `inlineConeT` / `resolveSlicesT` total twins +
  width/eval preservation (`cone_agrees_with_fold`,
  `cone_resolved_agrees_with_fold`); goal generators call the twins.
- [x] `#verify_elab` per-instance chain: `regstep` / `state_trace` /
  `signal_runModule` / `signal_sv` (Signal ≡ runModule ≡ runModuleSV).
- [x] Deep-side G1 glue (`{f}_deep_coneEval_*`): the general-theorem
  route's `Cdo.irState` cone terms land on the bridge language.
- [x] **Replay the bridge stack over `Cdo.irState`** — DONE.
  `#verify_elab_deep` emits per circuit: `{f}_deep_envAt` (the seed
  `envOfC nm (natJoin (irState t) inp)`), `_deep_seed_bounded`
  (`envOfC_bounded` + `irState_eq` + `BitVec.isLt` — no fold-side
  bounds), pointwise seed readers (`_deep_envAt_r{i}` / `_i{j}` /
  `_other`), `_deep_step_{reg}`, `_deep_regstep`, `_deep_envSt` /
  `_deep_st0` / `_deep_envSt_bounded`, `_deep_state_trace`, and per
  output port `_deep_signalM0` / `_deep_step_out` / `_deep_signal_fold`
  / **`_deep_signal_run`** (unconditional: Signal ≡ runModule trace).
  Struct outputs share one recurrence via `Cdo.irState_congr` (irState
  reads only next/inits).  Holds on all 13 demos + crc32Engine; the
  bridge lemmas are sorryAx-audited like the capstone.
- [x] **`evalOk` — absolute fold-success.**  `evalExpr` fails only on
  shape, so a decidable `evalOk` checker + soundness discharges fold
  success unconditionally; `{f}_signal_run` is the resulting
  hypothesis-free corollary.  (Deep-side / `signal_sv` still take a
  run hypothesis — wiring those is follow-up.)

## B. IR → Verilog remainders

- [x] **Optimizer — as translation validation, formally.**  Instead of
  proving `optimizeModule` (1.1 kloc, ten partial defs), the chain is
  CARRIED ACROSS it per instance.  Measured on every certified circuit,
  the optimizer changes an elaborator module's fully-inlined,
  slice-resolved cones in exactly one way — `inlineSingleUseWires`
  re-inserts identity width masks `and [e, const (2^w-1) w]` — and after
  `stripMask` (Tools/ConeFoldOpt.lean, with `stripMask_eval` on bounded
  envs via `sfrag_eval_bounded`) the optimized cones are SYNTACTICALLY
  the original ones.  `#verify_elab` now emits, over the OPTIMIZED body
  (the module `toVerilog (optimizeModule m)` actually prints; raw
  statement order, no topo-sort needed): `{f}_bodyOpt`, per-register
  `_maskEq_*` (native_decide), `_stepOpt_*`, `_regstepOpt`,
  `_state_traceOpt`, `_stepOpt_out`, `_signal_foldOpt`,
  `_signal_runModuleOpt`, `_signal_runOpt`, and **`{f}_signal_svOpt`** —
  Signal ≡ the Verilog-subset semantics of the emission of the optimized
  module, every cycle.  All 7 #verify_elab circuits (the optimizer may
  re-root a register at an alias-free input wire — twoReg — so cones
  are rooted at the OPTIMIZED registers, identities checked equal).
  Formalizes #verify_emit's informal "stepwise ⇒ sequential" claim.
  Remaining (optional): the same opt-bridge on the deep route; genuine
  per-pass optimizer proofs are no longer needed for circuit-do designs.
- [x] **M3 string layer — per instance.**  `#verify_elab` now emits
  `{f}_text := toVerilog (optimizeModule m)` (the printed Verilog),
  `{f}_text_parses` (the shipping parser+lowerer applied to that text
  yields `{f}_bodyRT`, by `native_decide` — the parser is trusted as an
  EVALUATED ORACLE, not proven), and replays the chain over `bodyRT`:
  **`{f}_signal_runRT`** — Signal ≡ runModule of the body the shipping
  parser reads back from the printed text, every cycle.  Registers are
  matched by name (the reparse lists them in another order); cones are
  mask-equal after `stripMask`.  All 7 #verify_elab circuits.
  What remains research-scale and is NOT claimed: a verified
  printer/parser inverse for the SV sub-language (a total renderer
  proven equal to the shipping printer + correctness of the 1 kloc,
  26-partial-def recursive-descent parser).  The trusted base here is
  "the parser as executed on this text", the same class as the
  native_decide checker discharges.
- [ ] **M4 residual fragment** — the honest exclusions: byte-strobe
  RMW `shl` width rule, `CVT32ModuleS0`'s `sub 0'7 x` cone (not
  carry-free).  Revisit only via a width-indexed `emit_sem` if ever
  worth it (measured payoff was ~1 array; parked).

## C. Deep-elaborator coverage

- [ ] **uart orphan goal** — `uartTxHW` is 21→1; the last is an
  ill-scoped postponed-unifier side goal.  Needs a deep-API change:
  remove `Γr.get` from the cone types (per-circuit literal-width
  fields, or an explicit width-vector variant), not another tactic.
- [ ] Nested `circuit do` composition.
- [ ] Non-Signal value parameters.
- [ ] Memories / sub-instances (`.inst`) in the deep grammar.
- [ ] Bridge v1 limits: register inputs that aren't `.ref` wires
  (emission currently skipped); memory-bearing modules (memFree
  premise).

## D. Trust base

- [ ] **`native_decide` → `decide` hardening** where feasible.  Many
  checker/equation discharges ride `ofReduceBool`.  HashMap paths
  can't kernel-reduce (USize hashing); list-shaped stop sets / width
  tables could.
- [ ] Closed hierarchical semantics (`.inst` as state trees /
  flattening proof).  Research boundary; hier co-sim covers it
  dynamically today.

## E. Housekeeping

- [x] CI green (Build: umbrella imports + `sparkleModuleDeps` +
  SVParser hard-link args; zero-width symbolic-width guard).
- [x] PR #134 body refreshed (seam / composition / bug #14).
- [x] `docs/CertifiedRoundtrip-design.md` — seam / composition / bug
  #14 sections added; bug numbering aligned to the PR table (14).
- [x] Zero-width pin test — a compile-time `run_cmd` in VerifyElabDemo
  asserts no `logic [0:0]` remnant (the exe path hits the circuit-do
  inline-synth gap, so the pin lives in the `lake env lean` file).
- [ ] Untracked scratch files at repo root (`episode.json`,
  `multiDeck.json`, `schedule`, resubmission draft) — decide keep vs
  gitignore vs remove.
